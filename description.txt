Introduction
Take a look at the following REST endpoints:
https://cgjresszgg.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/users/
https://cgjresszgg.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/teams/
Append the IDs of users and teams to get further information about each entity, e.g.
https://cgjresszgg.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/users/fd282131-d8aa-4819-b0c8-d9e0bfb1b75c
https://cgjresszgg.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/teams/7676a4bf-adfe-415c-941b-1739af07039b
This is the Teams REST service and it has a list of users, each user can be part of zero or more teams. Each team has
one user as a team lead.
Main task
Build a UI showing an overview of all the teams, and allow the current user to navigate between teams to see each
team's members. At the top of the teams overview page, add an input field, which filters the teams when the input
value changes. This input field could also be used in other pages of your app, e.g. for filtering out team members in
the team page.
What we are looking for:
Unit tests, routing, state management (going full redux or similar is not necessary). The UI does not need to look
good, unless you are applying for a more UI centric front-end developer role here at Tempo.
Must have
- README.md : describing how you approach the problem and/or solution and most importantly how to run (best
to keep it simple). If using a boilerplate (such as create-react-app) please denote where the most important pieces
of code reside.
- Code!! github url/tarball/zip/etc
Recommended
- React is preferred.
